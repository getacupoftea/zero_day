 Hello Ubuntu

Title/Project Name: Setting up your local coding environment

Description: This project guides you through setting up a virtual machine on your computer using Ubuntu. Whether you're a developer, tester, or just eager to explore Ubuntu in a virtualized environment, these instructions will help you get started.

Installation: Download Ubuntu
Install Ubuntu
Complete the setup process and configure and customize to your own preference.

Usage: Launch the Ubuntu virtual machine
Familiarize yourself with Ubuntu within the virtual environment.

Now, let’s move to the tasks;

TASK 0:  You will need Git for this project, you might have to install it on your computer if it’s not done yet.
* Configure your basic info (name, email) on your local machine – they will be part of your commits. Tips
On GitHub.com:
* Using the graphic interface on the website, create the repository (if it’s not done yet)
    * Description: This is my first repository as a full-stack engineer
    * Public repo: zero_day
    * No README, .gitignore, or license
On your computer, open a terminal and do the following:
* Navigate to your home directory. Tips
* Create a directory zero_day. Tips
* Navigate to this new directory. Tips
* Initialize git and add the remote origin
* Create a file README.md with Emacs (or other command line editors) and write a small Markdown text to present this project. This file is mandatory in projects
* Add this new file to git, commit the change with this message “My first commit” and push to the remote server / origin (Note: You will probably need to set your login/password to push to the remote server)
Good job!
You pushed your first file in your first repository of the first task of your first School project.

Explanation- First: Create a new repository named; “zero_day” on github using the website. 

The Description: This is my first repository as a full-stack engineer, but do not add any README.md file, .gitignore, or license

Secondly: clone the repository on your local machine using the “git clone” command and the repository URL.

Thirdly: navigate into the project directory using the “cd” command, create a README.md file, but with contents.

Then, git add, git commit and git push 

TASK 2: 100.0%)
Inside the zero_day repo, create a new directory called 0x00-vagrant. Add a README.md file to this directory.
ssh into your Ubuntu VM. What does the command uname print when you run it without any option?
Type your answer into a file in the 0x00-vagrant directory and push it to GitHub. Name your file accordingly as shown below.
Repo:
* GitHub repository: zero_day
* Directory: 0x00-vagrant
* File: 0-hello_ubuntu

Explanation - First: In the “zero_day” repository, create a directory named “0x00-vagrant” using the “mkdir” command; like this: mkdir 0x00-vagrant. 

Secondly: Create a non empty README.md file in this new, just created directory

Thirdly: The question “What does the command uname print when you run it without any option?” should be answered but in a new file. If you run uname on your terminal without any option, what does it print? For me, it is “Linux”.

So, I created my file “0-hello_ubuntu”  and typed my answer “Linux” in it.

Next, git push your files
